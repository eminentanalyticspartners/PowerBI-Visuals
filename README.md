# HealthCare Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This healthcare analytics project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the operational performance of a hospital network over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of healthcare data, the goal is to uncover trends, offer data-driven recommendations, and gain deeper insights into the network's operational efficiencies and patient outcomes.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset utilized for this analysis is sourced from the hospital network's electronic health records (EHR) system, providing detailed information about patient encounters, treatments, outcomes, and operational metrics.

HCP Data: This encompasses details about individuals employed within various hospitals of the Apollo Group, including doctors and their respective information.

HCO Data: This encompasses information about institutions and entities within the healthcare sector, such as hospitals, clinics, medical practices, healthcare facilities, and healthcare systems.

### Tools:
* Excel: Data Cleaning
* Python: Data Preparation
* SQL Server: Data Analysis and Querying
* Power BI: Visualization and Reporting


### Data Cleaning and Preparation

During the data preparation phase, the following tasks were undertaken:
1. Loading and initial inspection of EHR data.
2. Cleaning and formatting to handle missing values and ensure data integrity.
3. Transformation of raw data into structured formats suitable for analysis.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### EDA focused on extracting insights to address key questions in healthcare analytics:

-What are the trends in patient admissions and discharges?

-Which medical specialties have the highest patient volumes?

-Are there seasonal variations in healthcare service utilization?

### Data Analysis

Some interesting features/Code worked with: 

Example SQL Query:

***
SELECT specialty, COUNT(patient_id) AS patient_count
FROM patient_encounters
GROUP BY specialty
ORDER BY patient_count DESC;
***

### Results and Findings

Key findings from the analysis include:

-Patient admissions show a seasonal trend, with higher volumes during certain months.

-Specialties like Cardiology and Orthopedics have the highest patient volumes.

-Emergency department utilization spikes during weekends and evenings.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. Optimize staffing levels during peak admission periods to improve patient care and reduce wait times.
2. Enhance resources and services in high-volume specialties to meet patient demand effectively.
3. Implement predictive analytics models to forecast patient admissions and optimize resource allocation.

### Limitations

Certain limitations were encountered during the analysis:

1. Variability in data quality across different hospital departments.
2. Data privacy and regulatory constraints affect the scope of analysis.
3. Challenges in integrating disparate data sources for a unified analysis.
